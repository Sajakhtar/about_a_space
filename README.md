## About

[About a Space](https://about-a-space.herokuapp.com/) is a marketplace for office spaces, conference rooms, and event/function halls. It is akin to Airbnb for commercial spaces design to allow building lease owners to unlock a new revenue stream by renting out their space capacity in their buildings/offices when their staff are readily working from home. It also allows people working from home or digital nomads to easily find a space to work and collaborate, when they want a change of scene from their work setup at home. It also provides an alternative to coffee shope, by providing a guaranteed space for desired amount of days.

It was developed in 1 week as the penultimate project for batch #676 of the [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/) Web Development Bootcamp in Dubai.

About a Space is a Ruby on Rails web app that uses a base template from [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com) team.

Currently it was designed to be fully responsive.
